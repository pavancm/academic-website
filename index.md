### Quality Assessment of Stitched Images
I'm a postdoctoral researcher at Carnegie Mellon University, Silicon Valley, currently researching for the Integrated Symbolic Execution for Space-Time Analysis of Code (ISSTAC) project, which is funded by [DARPA STAC](http://www.darpa.mil/program/space-time-analysis-for-cybersecurity). I also worked on a NASA project on safety analysis of flight critical systems. My current focus is on identifying algorithmic complexity vulnerabilities using symbolic execution with heuristic exploration.

### Research Interests
My current research interests include:

- *Symbolic Analysis:* I work on [Symbolic PathFinder](http://babelfish.arc.nasa.gov/trac/jpf/wiki/projects/jpf-symbc), a symbolic execution engine built on the software model checker [Java PathFinder](http://babelfish.arc.nasa.gov/trac/jpf). I also maintain [JDart](https://github.com/psycopaths/jdart), a dynamic symbolic execution engine.
- *Probabilistic Software Analysis:* I'm working on analysis of software placed in stochastic environments, e.g., with the goal of quantifying how *likely* a target event is to occur.
- *Machine Learning:* I'm investigating how to leverage machine learning techniques as a heuristic for symbolic analysis. I also used machine learning for mining log data from flight-critical systems.

### Background
Before joining Carnegie Mellon University in 2014, I was affiliated with Aalborg University in Denmark, where I completed my B.Sc. in Software Engineering (2009), M.Sc. Cum Laude in Software Engineering (2011), and Ph.D. in Computer Science (2014).

During my Ph.D., I worked on temporal verification of real-time embedded systems using a combination of static analysis and Timed Automata model checking using the [UPPAAL](http://www.uppaal.org/) model checker. As part of this effort, I developed TetaSARTS, a tool for generating a Timed Automata description from Java real-time systems written in Safety Critical Java. Among others, I also developed a time predictable version of the [Hardware near Virtual Machine](http://www.icelab.dk/) (HVM), a lean and portable JVM implementation targeting embedded systems.

In 2013, I was a visiting researcher at [NASA Ames Research Center](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/home/index.html), Mountain View, where I worked with [Corina Păsăreanu](https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/profile/pcorina/) on symbolic execution, temporal analysis of systems, and probabilistic software analysis.
